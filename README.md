## 🚀 Who am I?

I’m **Tunjay Akbarli**, also known as **Hekimoghlu**, a self-taught technologist and founder of **NeXTHub**, a next-generation ecosystem unifying everything into one powerful platform.

- Born on January 5, 2010 🇦🇿 and raised by a love for machines, I wrote my first lines of code at **age 8**.
- At **8**, I founded my first **computer club**, which became a **startup at 11**.
- By **10**, I was developing tools, reverse-engineering binaries, and understanding systems deeper than most adults.
- Now, I'm building a platform that makes traditional workflows, tools, and roles feel obsolete.

> I don’t just write code — I design ecosystems, create languages, and redefine how humans interact with technology.
